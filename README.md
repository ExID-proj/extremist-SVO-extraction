This is an improved version of Subject/Verb/Object extraction using Spacy (we extended the model in https://github.com/peter3125/enhanced-subject-verb-object-extraction).

    Improving the passive verb support
    Improving the noun-phrase expansion
    Improving identifying objects joined by conjunctions
    Improving negation support
    Improving the subject detection - i.e. taking into account the occurences of 'who'
    Improving the object detection
